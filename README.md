# Monkey-Ball-HD-Save-Manager
A tool to switch saves between multiple users in Banana Blitz HD for PC

This tool is necessary since the encrypted save files have a steam ID check that corrupts the file if it doesnt match your profile ID

Prerequisites:
--------------

To use this tool you will need your 64bit Steam ID

To find your 64bit ID follow these steps:

	1. Copy your steam profile URL
  
	2. Paste it into this website: https://steamid.io/lookup/
  
	3. Copy the ID64 and store it somewhere safe, you'll need it to run the program

Running the program:
--------------------

//IT IS RECOMMENDED TO SHUT THE GAME BEFORE A FILE TRANSFER//

Instructions: 

0. A safety feature is enabled that requires you to always backup before use; this can be turned off using the checkbox in the program if you dont wish to backup or already have a backup

1. The 100% file is already in the correct folder; if you wish to use a different save file then move the save you wish to put into the game into /SAVE/ and rename it: user_param.sav 

2. Plug your ID into the input field and click the run button. This will decrypt your wanted save file in order to inject your steam ID and will then re-encrypt the file to be read by the game.

3. The file will be loaded inside the game for use if injecting works
